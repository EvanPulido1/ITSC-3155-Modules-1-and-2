# Ask the user to input a string
word = str(input('Enter a string: '))

# Create an empty list
list = []

# Use a for loop to iterate through the string and add each letter into a list
for x in word:
    list.append(x)

# Print the list 
print(list)

# I did not learn how to split lists into sublists
# Here is a link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-split-a-list-into-sublists-of-given-lengths/
# I did not understand how it works
